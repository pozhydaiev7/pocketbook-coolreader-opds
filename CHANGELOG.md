# Changelog

## 0.0.6-17-63-opds — 2026-10-26

Based on blchinezu/pocketbook-coolreader 0.0.6-17-62.1.

### Added

- **OPDS catalog browser** (`cr3gui/src/opds`). Default catalog: Flibusta.
  - Opened from the touch quick menu icon or from *Settings → OPDS catalog*.
  - Catalog sections, search, two-line book lists with a pager row (*Back*, page number with the catalog menu, *Next*).
  - Next catalog pages are loaded on demand.
  - Book screen: description, *Download and open* in every format CoolReader reads (FB2.ZIP preferred), links to related books.
  - Books are downloaded with libcurl into `/mnt/ext1/Books/Flibusta`, checked (HTML error pages are rejected) and opened at once. The position of the current book is saved first.
  - Wi-Fi is connected on demand through the firmware.
  - The on-screen keyboard is opened from a placeholder window, so the reader stays in front after input.
- **Settings:**
  - *OPDS catalog* and *OPDS catalog address* (`cr3.pocketbook.opds.url`);
  - the download folder (`cr3.pocketbook.opds.dir`), set in `cr3.ini`.
- **Catalog icon** in the touch menu of the pb740fw5, pb631fw5 and pb626fw5 skins.
- **pb740fw5 skin** for 1404×1872 screens (from the 0.0.6-17-62.2 community build).
- **Cite toolbar:**
  - *Up* / *Down* buttons in skins with nine cite buttons;
  - all buttons work by touch.
- Page margin value 350.
- Host-side parser test with saved Flibusta feeds (`cr3gui/src/opds/test`).

### Changed

- **Firmware 6.11 support:**
  - libpng and libjpeg are linked statically from `thirdparty/` and are not exported (`-Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL`);
  - freetype is built without bzip2, png and harfbuzz;
  - the binary no longer needs `libpng12.so.0`, `libjpeg.so.8` or `libbz2.so.1.0`.
- **Launcher:**
  - exports `GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.rtld.execstack=2` for the 6.11 executable-stack restriction;
  - a syntax error in its crash-detection block is fixed.
- **Touch skins.** The touch quick menu and the new TOC are enabled for the FW5+ skins pb740fw5, pb700fw5, pbXfw5 and pb617fw5, in addition to pb626fw5 and pb631fw5.
- **High-density screens** (long side ≥ 1400 px): settings menu fonts, the touch menu page counter and the battery icon are scaled by 1.5.
- **Dictionary:**
  - touch selection picks the tapped entry;
  - the number of lines fits the window;
  - the exact-match lookup is disabled.
- **Network requests** (`web.cpp`):
  - connect and transfer timeouts;
  - HTTP status and curl errors are logged;
  - no signals are used.
- **Data files** from the community build: `keymaps.ini` (pro5), `dict.css` and the Russian manual.
- The *OTA update* settings item is hidden. It would replace this build with the upstream release.
- Russian translation of all new strings.
